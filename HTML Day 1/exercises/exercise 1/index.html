        <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>HTML</strong> is the
          <strong><u>HyperText Markup Language</u></strong> used to describe web
          pages. #
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>HyperText</strong> is what you use daily to move around on the
          web — by dd on certain elements called hyperlinks which direct your
          browser to the next page.
        </p>
        <p>
          The word <strong><u>“hyper”</u></strong> just means it does not
          function linearly — meaning you can go to any place on the internet
          from any other place — which is what allows the modern internet as we
          know it to function.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>HTML</strong> is <strong>not</strong> a
          <strong><u>programming language</u></strong
          >; it is a <strong>markup language</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Markup</strong> is used to tell your browser how to structure
          the web pages you visit.
        </p>
        <p>
          A web page consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose
          or mark up different parts of the content (like page title, or
          paragraphs) to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way.
        </p>
        <p>
          X<strong>HTML</strong> consists of a series of short codes typed into
          a text-file by the site author — these are the elements.
        </p>

        <h3>HTML Elements</h3>
        <p>Tags are used to define where an HTML element starts and ends.</p>
        <p>
          A start (opening) tag is made up of an opening angle bracket (&lt; )
          followed by the name of the element, one or more space separated
          attribute/value pairs, and for the end (closing) tag a closing angle
          bracket ( ).
        </p>
        <p>
          end tag consists of a forward slash (/) written before the element
          name.

        <h3>HTML Tags</h3>
        <dl>
          <dt><strong>!DOCTYPE html</strong></dt>
          <dd>This tag defines the document type and HTML version.</dd>
          <dt><strong>html</strong></dt>
          <dd>
            This tag encloses the complete HTML document and mainly contains a
            document header which is represented by head.../head and a document
            body which is represented by body.../body tags.
          </dd>
          <dt><strong>head</strong></dt>
          <dd>
            This tag represents the document's header which can keep other HTML
            tags like title, link etc.
          </dd>
          <dt><strong>title</strong></dt>
          <dd>
            The <strong>title</strong> tag is used inside the
            <strong>head</strong> tag to mention the document title.
          </dd>
          <dt><strong>body</strong></dt>
          <dd>
            This tag represents the document's body which keeps other HTML tags
            like <strong>h1</strong>, <strong>div</strong>,
            <strong>p</strong> etc.
