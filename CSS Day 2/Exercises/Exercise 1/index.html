        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <hr />
        <ul>
          <li>3 egg white,</li>
          <li>1 pinch salt,</li>
          <li>1 cup white sugar,</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch,</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon lemon juice.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <hr />
        <ol>
          <li>
            Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line a sheet pan
            with parchment paper. Draw a 9 inch circle on the parchment. An easy
            way to do this is to draw around the outside of a 9 inch pan with a
            pencil.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a large bowl, beat egg whites on high speed until soft peaks
            form. Add 3/4 cup of the sugar gradually, while continuing to whip.
            Make sure sugar is completely dissolved. Mix together the remaining
            1/4 cup sugar with the cornstarch; lightly fold into meringue with
            lemon juice.
          </li>
          <li>
            "Spread a layer of meringue to fit a circle on parchment,
            approximately 1/4 inch thick. With the remainder of mixture, a pipe
            or spoon swirls around the edges to form a shallow bowl shape.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a large bowl, combine the cream and half a cup of confectioners
            sugar, and whip until thickened. Decorate with fruit of your choice;
            strawberries are excellent.
          </li>
        </ol>
